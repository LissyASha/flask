# Flask Sample App with Tests

This is a simple Flask web application with unit tests. The application provides a basic REST API for managing a list of items. It serves as a starting point for learning how to create a Flask application and write tests for it.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `app/`: Contains the Flask application and routes.
- `tests/`: Houses unit tests for the application.
- `run.py`: A script to run the Flask application.
